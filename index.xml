Goals With this new platform, we aim to provide a convenient, centralised location for all your Rchaeological needs, from general R resources for beginners, to more advanced R topics in archaeology and related disciplines.
We will offer occasional posts on various topics on a completely unpredictable schedule.</description></item><item><title>Beginners</title><link>https://rchaeology.github.io/resources/beginners/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 12:04:39 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://rchaeology.github.io/resources/beginners/</guid><description>üëã Welcome So you want to learn R?

Goals We aspire to make the R programming language accessible to all archaeologists, and provide an open, welcoming community for all those who are interested in learning. We also want to help Rchaeologists find one another, whether for collaboration, getting help with field-specific R questions, or just to nerd out and chat about R.</description></item></channel></rss>
